# AngularTodo

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.2.

## Into

Very simple todo app, I mean making a todo app with a new tech is always the first step to learning something new.

I did use some stuff I usually have in most of my other projects (vite or next):
- TailwindCSS [link to angular docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/angular)
- Lucide React [just svgs because I got lazy](https://lucide.dev/icons/)
- Angular itself :) [confusing docs but useful](https://angular.dev/overview)

## Conclusion

### Do I love it?
No I still prefer react, the setup itself was annoying like google itself was asking for my data during project intialization, they really can't get enough lol.
If anything it's not that hard it's somewhat similar to react, or nestjs in a way.

### Will I use it in my perosnal projects?
Hell nah

## Bye :D
